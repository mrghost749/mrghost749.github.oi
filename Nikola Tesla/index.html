  <p>The fusion of Nikola Tesla's genius and nuclear theory</p>
</header>

<section id="about">
  <h2>About Nikola Tesla</h2>
  <p>Nikola Tesla was one of the most brilliant inventors and scientists in history. Born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, which is now in Croatia, Tesla showed signs of genius from a young age. He had a photographic memory and could visualize complex machines in his mind before even building them.

    Tesla studied engineering in Austria but never completed his degree. He worked for a while with the famous inventor Thomas Edison in the United States. However, their relationship turned sour due to differences in ideas and personalities. While Edison supported direct current (DC) electricity, Tesla championed alternating current (AC), which eventually became the standard for electric power worldwide.
    
    Tesla’s AC system was more efficient for long-distance electricity transmission. In partnership with industrialist George Westinghouse, Tesla's AC system defeated Edison’s DC system during the “War of Currents.” Thanks to Tesla, we have modern electric power grids today.
    
    Tesla’s inventions didn't stop there. He developed the Tesla coil, a high-voltage transformer that is still used in radio technology. He also worked on wireless communication, even before Marconi sent the first transatlantic radio signal. Tesla actually filed patents that later played a key role in the development of radio.
    
    He dreamed big—Tesla wanted to provide free, wireless energy to the entire world. He built a massive tower called the Wardenclyffe Tower for this purpose. However, the project ran out of funds and was never completed.
    
    Tesla was a pioneer in fields like robotics, remote control, radar, and X-rays. Many of his ideas were ahead of his time and could not be realized with the technology available then.
    
    Despite his genius, Tesla was not good with money. He lived most of his later years in poverty, working alone and often misunderstood. He died on January 7, 1943, in New York City, in a small hotel room.
    
    Today, Tesla is remembered as a visionary who changed the world. The electric car company “Tesla,” named after him, honors his contributions to electrical engineering. His ideas continue to inspire scientists, engineers, and dreamers even today.
    
    Nikola Tesla was more than an inventor—he was a dreamer who imagined a better future for humanity. His life teaches us that true genius is not just about success or fame, but about the courage to dream and the passion to create.

  <h2>Tesla's Theories</h2>
  <p>Nikola Tesla was not only an inventor but also a deep thinker and visionary scientist. His theories spanned across electricity, magnetism, wireless communication, and energy transfer. Many of his ideas were revolutionary and even seemed impossible at the time. Here's an overview of some of Tesla’s most significant theories:

    ---.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>1. Alternating Current (AC) Theory</h2>
    <p>Tesla’s most famous theory was about the use of alternating current (AC) instead of direct current (DC). He believed that AC was more efficient for transmitting electricity over long distances. He proved this by developing AC generators, transformers, and motors, forming the basis of modern electrical power systems.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>2. Rotating Magnetic Field</h2>
    <p>Tesla developed the theory of rotating magnetic fields, which became the foundation of AC induction motors. This idea explained how an electric current could be used to produce rotational movement—something crucial in every modern motor and appliance.</p>
</section>

<section id="nuclear">
  <h2>Nuclear Concepts</h2>
  <p>While Tesla didn’t directly work with nuclear physics, some modern theorists connect his work with zero-point energy and concepts overlapping quantum field theory and nuclear energy exploration.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>3. Wireless Power Transmission</h2>

        <p>Tesla strongly believed that energy could be transmitted wirelessly through the atmosphere using high-frequency signals. His experiments with the Tesla Coil showed that it was possible to send power wirelessly over short distances. His ambitious Wardenclyffe Tower project aimed to provide free global wireless electricity, but it was never completed due to financial problems.
        
        ---</p>
        
       <h2> 4. Resonant Frequency and Vibration</h2>
        
        <p>Tesla discovered that everything in the universe has a natural frequency. He believed that energy could be transferred efficiently using resonance. His experiments showed that when two objects vibrate at the same frequency, energy could pass between them with minimal loss. This idea forms the basis of many wireless technologies today.
        
        ---</p>
        
       <h2> 5. Radio Waves and Remote Control</h2>
        
        <p>Before Marconi, Tesla had developed theories and even demonstrated radio wave transmission and remote control. In 1898, he showcased a radio-controlled boat, which was far ahead of its time. He understood how electromagnetic waves could be used for communication and control, laying the groundwork for radio, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.
        
        ---</p>
        
        <h2>6. Earth as a Conductor</h2>
        
        <p>Tesla believed that Earth itself could conduct electrical energy, and he proposed a system where energy could be sent through the ground or the atmosphere to power devices anywhere in the world. Though this theory wasn’t fully realized, parts of it are studied even today in earth resonance and wireless energy research.
        
        ---</p>
        
       <h2> 7. Free Energy Concepts</h2>
        
        <p>Tesla theorized that the universe is full of energy and that it should be possible to harness this energy directly from nature without burning fuel. He referred to concepts like the “ether” or cosmic energy, which were not accepted by mainstream science at the time. Some believe he was working on zero-point energy ideas.
        
        ---</p>
        
        <h2>8. Scalar Waves and Wireless Communication</h2>
        
        <p>Tesla talked about a type of wave—scalar or longitudinal waves—that could travel faster than light and penetrate any material. These waves are not widely accepted in modern physics but are still studied in alternative science circles today.</h2>
